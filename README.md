# PCAirflowChecker1 and PCAirflowChecker2
This Java project calculates the amount of positive and negative pressure in PC fan configurations.  

Positive pressure: More air is being pushed into the case than is being exhausted. This can help reduce dust but may lead to heat buildup.  

Negative pressure: More air is being expelled out of the case than is being intaked. This can efficently expel hot air but may lead to dust.

## PCAirflowChecker1 Feature
- Calculates different CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) ratings for each fan, allowing for more flexibility in fan performance. 

## PCAirflowChecker2 Feature
- Calculates the same CFM ratings for all fans, allowing to be more simple in overall airflow.
